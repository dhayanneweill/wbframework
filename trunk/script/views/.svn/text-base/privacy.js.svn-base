Similarly, when one of your friends visits a pre-approved website or application, it will receive General Information about you so you and your friend can be connected on that website as well (if you also have an account with that website).   In these cases we require these websites and applications to go through an approval process, and to enter into separate agreements designed to protect your privacy.  For example, these agreements include provisions relating to the access and deletion of your General Information, along with your ability to opt-out of the experience being offered.  You can disable instant personalization on all pre-approved websites and applications using your privacy settings.

We use the information to prevent potentially illegal activities, and to enforce our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities.

For example, we might use your interest in soccer to show you ads for soccer equipment, but we do not tell the soccer equipment company who you are.

	    	 .replace("{PARAM61}","To serve social ads. We occasionally pair advertisements we serve with relevant information we have about you and your friends to make advertisements more interesting and more tailored to you and your friends.

We may use information about you that we collect from other Whatoodo users to supplement your profile (such as when you are tagged in a photo or mentioned in a status update).

Similarly, if one of your friends uploads a picture of you, we may suggest that your friend tag you in the picture. We do this by comparing your friend’s pictures to information we’ve put together from the photos you’ve been tagged in.  We may also suggest that you use certain tools and features based on what your friends have used.

When you deactivate an account, no user will be able to see it, but it will not be deleted.

Many users deactivate their accounts for temporary reasons and in doing so are asking us to maintain their information until they return to Whatoodo. You will still have the ability to reactivate your account and restore your profile in its entirety. When you delete an account, it is permanently deleted from Whatoodo.
